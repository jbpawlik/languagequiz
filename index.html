        <h2>Which Programming Language is Right for You?</h2>
        <p>An increasing number of people have become interested in the drama and intrigue of what goes on behind their phone and computer screens. Some are trying to make a career out of programming computers, while others are looking to explore coding as a hobby. Either way, to learn to code you must learn to speak the language of computers.</p>
        <p>Just like human beings, computers speak a variety of languages. The most basic is binary, a series of zeroes and ones (think on/off, or yes/no). Very few people can program in binary. Modern languages use words, symbols, and punctuation to communicate with computers.</p>
        <p>Most newcomers to programming want to know, "Which language should I learn?" The answer is complicated. Each language has strengths and weaknesses, but the common advice is to learn any language as the basic principles of computer programming are the same. Once you have a grasp on what a language is doing, you can then apply that understanding to another language.</p>
        <p>That said, there are many differences between the languages. Use our handy guide to figure out which one might be right for you.</p>

          <p>A child in elementary school can learn how to program, but may only be able to access pseudo-code projects like those found on <a href="http://code.org">Code.org</a> with the support of their parents. This is an excellent way to introduce the joy of programming to younger children.</p>
