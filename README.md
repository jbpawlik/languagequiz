# Programming Language Quiz
## by James Benjamin Pawlik (http://github.com/jbpawlik)

### __Description__
Which Programming Language is Right for You? is an interactive website that helps newcomers to programming choose which first language might be right for them. It asks a series of questions about the user's demographics and interests, then outputs a suggested language or languages.

### __Setup/Installation__
1. Clone the [repository](http://github.com/jbpawlik/languagequiz) to your local machine
2. Navigate to the top level of the directory
3. Open index.html in your browser

Alternately, visit [Github Pages](http://jbpawlik.github.io/languagequiz) to view the site.

### __Known Bugs / Future Goals__
No bugs have been found or reported. Please contact the author if you experience poor performance.

Future plans for this site include adding more languages, giving more nuanced advice (i.e. whether "Which language should I learn?" is the first question newcomers should be concerned about), and adding additional styling and graphics. The author plans to update languages used in the survey as they wax and wane in popularity.
